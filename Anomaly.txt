
ANOMALY REPORT
In the 'stop.txt'  file I've read the file line by line.But in some cases one line does not contain the whole database of a stopage.So in that case my result will not be correct.It would be correct if the database of user entered stopage is in one line.
I've assumed that all the trips stops in all the stopage.
